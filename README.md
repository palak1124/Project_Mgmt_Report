# Project_Mgmt_Report
**Introduction**
Project management is not just about assigning tasks‚Äîit's about ensuring that every part of a project moves in the right direction, within timelines, and stays aligned with the organizational goals. As part of my learning in data analytics and reporting, I worked on a Project Management and Tracking Dashboard using Power BI for the period April 2023 to March 2024.

The objective was to monitor ongoing projects, analyze sector-wise trends, and identify delays or progress through visual reporting. This project gave me practical exposure to how companies use business intelligence tools to track project efficiency, manage deadlines, and evaluate team performance across various sectors.

 **Project Content**
The Power BI dashboard is designed to offer a detailed view of various aspects of project management. It is divided into three core sections:

üìä Budget Analysis
This section presents a detailed comparison of allocated vs utilized budget for different projects and sectors. It helps identify where overspending or underutilization is happening. Through interactive visuals like bar graphs and KPIs, management can track which projects are staying within the budget and which require financial attention. This allows for better resource allocation and financial planning across ongoing projects.

üóìÔ∏è Project Timeline
The timeline visual showcases the start and end dates of each project, offering a clear picture of scheduling and delays. Gantt-style visuals help track project phases, deadlines, and dependencies. It provides a quick overview of which projects are on track, delayed, or completed, helping management intervene at the right time to avoid escalations.

üìã Project Details Overview
This part gives a comprehensive breakdown of each project, including project name, sector, team lead, current status (e.g., In Progress, Completed, Delayed), and other relevant details. Filters and slicers allow users to deep-dive into any specific project or sector. It ensures that all stakeholders have visibility on project status, responsibilities, and progress‚Äîenabling collaboration and accountability.

Each visual in the dashboard is interactive, dynamic, and created with real-time monitoring in mind. Together, these elements make this dashboard a powerful tool for strategic project planning and execution.

**My Learnings**
This project gave me valuable insights into how project data can be transformed into meaningful visuals for better tracking and planning. I learned:

How to clean and structure raw project data for reporting.

Designing dashboards that are easy to interpret for both management and team members.

Using DAX for custom calculations like status-based filtering, monthly comparisons, and dynamic insights.

Creating a smooth user experience in Power BI with slicers, legends, and tooltip configurations.

I also understood how real organizations rely on such dashboards to reduce project delays, manage team performance, and improve overall operational efficiency.
